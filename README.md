Andriod App used to control my IoT controlled Car. The Andriod app was based on React Native. I used React Native, as it was more suited to my frontend development background as it utilised CSS and Javascript, instead of say Kotlin or Java.

# Tools Used
* ```Node.js``` - Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment 
* ```react-native-elements``` UI Toolkit for React Native
* ```npm``` - A package manager for Javascript
* ```expo``` - Expo is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS
